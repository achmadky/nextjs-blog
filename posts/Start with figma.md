**Design is function, then form**. create something looks good is a result of good design. but, that was not the goal of good design as ui designer. the goal of good design is to create something does what its user intended to do and expexted(Functional).
when things work as expected, people see it as good. the priority in creating user interface on aplication is
Functional > Reliable > Enjoyable(Good Looking).

**Steve Jobs** said,

Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like, people think it's this veneerâ€”that the designers are handed this box and told, 'Make it look good!' That's not what we think design is. It's not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

imagine if the app is really good in design, but the button is not working properly. it would be bad experience as user.
so, that was not reliable.

**Thanks** that was the first tips on starting in figma!
See you later~
