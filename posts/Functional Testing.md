**Functional Testing** is performed using the functional specification provided by the client and verifies the system against the functional requirements.


**Functional Testing** is executed first. 
## Examples of Functional testing are:


**Unit Testing**  is a type of software testing where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software code performs as expected. Unit Testing is done during the development (coding phase) of an application by the developers.

**Smoke Testing**  is a software testing process that determines whether the deployed software build is stable or not. we are verifying whether the important features are working.

**Sanity Testing** is a kind of Software Testing performed after receiving a software build, with minor changes in code, or functionality, to ascertain that the bugs have been fixed and no further issues are introduced due to these changes. 

**Integration Testing**  is defined as a type of testing where software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. A typical software project consists of multiple software modules, coded by different programmers.

**White Box Testing** is a testing technique which checks the internal functioning of the system. In this method, testing is based on coverage of code statements, branches, paths or conditions. White-Box testing is considered as low-level testing.

**Black Box Testing** a tester doesnâ€™t have any information about the internal working of the software system. Black box testing is a high level of testing that focuses on the behavior of the software. It involves testing from an external or end-user perspective.

**User Acceptance Testing** is a type of testing performed by the end user or the client to verify/accept the software system before moving the software application to the production environment. UAT is done in the final phase of testing after functional, integration and system testing is done. The main **Purpose of UAT** is to validate end to end business flow. 

**Regression Testing Testing**  is defined as a type of software testing to confirm that a recent program or code change has not adversely affected existing features.
