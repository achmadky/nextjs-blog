**Non-Functional Testing**  checks the  Performance, reliability, scalability and other non-functional aspects of the software system.


**Non-Functional Testing** should be performed after functional testing 
## Examples of Non-Functional testing are:


**Performance Testing**  is a software testing process used for testing the speed, response time, stability, reliability, scalability and resource usage of a software application under particular workload. The main purpose of performance testing is to identify and eliminate the performance bottlenecks in the software application.

**Load Testing** is a non-functional software testing process in which the performance of software application is tested under a specific expected load. It determines how the software application behaves while being accessed by multiple users simultaneously. The goal of Load Testing is to improve performance bottlenecks and to ensure stability and smooth functioning of software application before deployment.


**Volume Testing** is a type of Software Testing, where the software is subjected to a huge volume of data. It is also referred to as flood testing. Volume testing is done to analyze the system performance by increasing the volume of data in the database.


**Stress Testing** is a type of software testing that verifies stability & reliability of software application. The goal of Stress testing is measuring software on its robustness and error handling capabilities under extremely heavy load conditions and ensuring that software doesnâ€™t crash under crunch situations. It even tests beyond normal operating points and evaluates how software works under extreme conditions.

**Security Testing** is a type of Software Testing that uncovers vulnerabilities, threats, risks in a software application and prevents malicious attacks from intruders. The purpose of Security Tests is to identify all possible loopholes and weaknesses of the software system which might result in a loss of information, revenue, repute at the hands of the employees or outsiders of the Organization.

**Installation Testing** is performed to check if the software has been correctly installed with all the inherent features and that the product is working as per expectations.

**Penetration Testing** is an attempt to evaluate the security of an IT infrastructure by safely trying to exploit vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities may exist in operating systems, services and application flaws, improper configurations or risky end-user behavior.

**Compatibility Testing** is a type of Software testing to check whether your software is capable of running on different hardware, operating systems, applications, network environments or Mobile devices.
