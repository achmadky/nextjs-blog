**UI/UX** focuses on the experience of customers when they search for our products.

Start with a customer journey, for example: Your customer is shopping for a pair of shoes. What will they see the first time they visit your website?

The elements of the cust journey should be considered when designing the solution, especially the order they are in from start to get what the customer wants, how smoothly they can progress to the next step

When processing a product, don't force information on just one page, consider the journey of your product so that it makes your product like a comfortable story to read

we need to make customer didnt confuse with the app. and make the customer understand what the app doing!
