Sometimes, It's good to start without content, fake content, and only focus on cust experience and layout, so that we can understand the shortcomings of our products. It is very important to map what we want to convey to customers, rather than doing unnecessary designs or duplicating existing pages, because this process helps us to understand the overall flow of our product.

**William Zinsser** said,
    Examine every word you put on paper. You'll find a surprising number that don't serve any purpose.

copying is not a good thing, because sometimes the copy design does not match and it actually damages our design. but, reference is different things.
