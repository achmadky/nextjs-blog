**Data Visualization** is not an easy thing to do, data visualization and design is both an art and a science. therefore, it is not easy. We are required to be able to tell about the data properly and have an impact on the content.


**Colouring**. color has an important role in data visualization. color is able to change the understanding received by people. like a color change from light to dark, dont use dark to light, it can make people confused.


**Complex And Simplicity**. always try to make graph as simple as possible. so that people more easily understand what are you going to tell. excessive appealing, attractive, eye catching, beauty can destroy the understanding.


**Size**. in presenting infographics must remain consistent. of course presenting a different size is also needed, but making the data size the same is a good thing too. adjust as needed.


**First Sequence**. sequence is very important. such as linegraph as much as possible from the low to the high. and keep making it easier to read.


**Placing**. always try to use small to largest or largest to small, except for month.
